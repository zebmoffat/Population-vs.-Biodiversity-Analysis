Keywords: Biodiversity, Population, Urban Environment

Description: The types of data I plan on analyzing are:
* Species present in the state of New York
* The distribution of present species
* Human population density and amount in New York state.

The questions I would like to ask about this data are:
* How correlated are high population density and biodiversity in an area?
* Is there a balance where smaller population sizes do not affect biodiversity?
* Are some species types more affected by high population?

Intellectual Merit: The potential of this project is to better understand how population affects biodiversity, especially in a highly populated state like New York. These findings could help ecological projects in saving the environment.

Data Sourcing: I plan on sourcing my data from government sources like data.gov. The nice thing about government data is that it is trustworthy and they make it easy to export the data with file formats like csv or xml. The data they provide is publically availible and generally doesn't have many restrictions.
